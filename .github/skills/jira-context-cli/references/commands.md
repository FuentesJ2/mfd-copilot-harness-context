# Jira Context CLI Commands

All commands in this skill use the isolated harness runtime:

```powershell
<workspace-root>/.github/tools/jira-context/jira-context.exe
```

This file is for normal day-to-day CLI usage.
Debugging and development-only commands live in [debugging.md](./debugging.md).

## Version Checks

Preferred runtime identity check:

```powershell
<workspace-root>/.github/tools/jira-context/jira-context.exe version --format json
```

Fallback when command execution is unavailable:

```powershell
Get-Content <workspace-root>/.github/tools/jira-context/VERSION.json
```

## Full Fetches

If you need a clear, single-command pattern, use this exact shape with no wrapper logic around it:

```powershell
C:/Dev/.github/tools/jira-context/jira-context.exe fetch test-case MFD-9212 --save-normalized-to C:/Dev/.github/tools/jira-context/jira-output/MFD-9212-normalized.json
```

Ask to run or approve the direct fetch command itself. Do not generate a PowerShell wrapper that captures stdout, branches between issue kinds, checks file creation, or prints sentinel markers.
Always include `--save-normalized-to` for agent-driven fetches, then open that saved JSON file directly.
Do not inspect Copilot chat-session transcript files such as `chat-session-resources/.../content.txt` when the normalized JSON file already exists.

Default agent fetch:

```powershell
<workspace-root>/.github/tools/jira-context/jira-context.exe fetch test-case MFD-7754 --save-normalized-to <workspace-root>/.github/tools/jira-context/jira-output/MFD-7754-normalized.json
```

Read the saved normalized file first:

```powershell
<workspace-root>/.github/tools/jira-context/jira-context.exe fetch test-case MFD-7754 --save-normalized-to <workspace-root>/.github/tools/jira-context/jira-output/MFD-7754-normalized.json
```

Fetch normalized test-case JSON and also save the raw payload JSON in `jira-output/`:

```powershell
<workspace-root>/.github/tools/jira-context/jira-context.exe fetch test-case MFD-7754 --save-normalized-to <workspace-root>/.github/tools/jira-context/jira-output/MFD-7754-normalized.json --save-raw-payload-to <workspace-root>/.github/tools/jira-context/jira-output/fetch-test-case-MFD-7754-full-raw-payload.json
```

The raw payload file for that command is written automatically to:

```text
<workspace-root>/.github/tools/jira-context/jira-output/fetch-test-case-MFD-7754-full-raw-payload.json
```

The normalized file is the canonical artifact the agent should read first. Access the stable keys directly from that JSON before doing any generic text processing.
After `--save-normalized-to`, read that saved file before any repo, code, or test search, and state the exact normalized keys you used.
Do not re-read terminal transcript output or `content.txt` capture files as a substitute for the saved normalized JSON.
For a requirement fetch, inspect this order first: `issue_key`, `summary`, `description`, `status`, `custom_fields`, `links`, then `comments`.
Unless the user explicitly asked for code or test impact, stop after the Jira summary and `Next Query Layers` instead of pivoting into workspace searches.
When the Tessie or MFD Test Script Agent workflow is active, still fetch live Jira data with this CLI first for named issue keys instead of substituting repository CSV exports.
The saved raw payload file is only for source-payload inspection when the schema is genuinely unknown or the user explicitly asks for it.
Use `jira-output/` for both normalized and raw saved JSON outputs.
Do not place runtime JSON payloads inside `.github/skills/`; keep them under the harness runtime area instead.
If you are unsure whether an issue is a `test-case` or `problem-report`, either ask the user or run one direct fetch at a time. Do not combine both attempts into a generated PowerShell control-flow script.

Fetch normalized requirement JSON and also save the raw payload JSON:

```powershell
<workspace-root>/.github/tools/jira-context/jira-context.exe fetch requirement DMFDREQ-1448 --save-normalized-to <workspace-root>/.github/tools/jira-context/jira-output/DMFDREQ-1448-normalized.json --save-raw-payload-to <workspace-root>/.github/tools/jira-context/jira-output/fetch-requirement-DMFDREQ-1448-full-raw-payload.json
```

Fetch normalized problem-report JSON and also save the raw payload JSON:

```powershell
<workspace-root>/.github/tools/jira-context/jira-context.exe fetch problem-report MFD-8100 --save-normalized-to <workspace-root>/.github/tools/jira-context/jira-output/MFD-8100-normalized.json --save-raw-payload-to <workspace-root>/.github/tools/jira-context/jira-output/fetch-problem-report-MFD-8100-full-raw-payload.json
```

## Advanced Fetch Options

Most users should ignore these unless they are intentionally widening the Jira API request.

### Why these flags exist

- `--field <name>` exists because the normal fetch only asks Jira for the small set of fields this workflow usually needs. If you need some extra Jira field that is not in the normal contract, this lets you ask for it directly. Without it, you miss that field entirely.
- `--expand <name>` exists because some Jira data is only available when Jira is told to expand it. Think of it as asking Jira to unfold extra details instead of giving you the short version. Without it, you may only get the compact form and miss richer nested data.
- `--property <key>` exists because Jira issue properties are a separate storage area from normal issue fields. If some integration stored useful data there, a normal fetch will not include it unless you ask. Without it, you miss those properties completely.
- `--fields-by-keys` exists because some Jira sites or workflows refer to fields by key names instead of numeric-looking ids like `customfield_12345`. This flag tells Jira how to interpret the field names you passed. Without it, a field request can fail or return nothing if Jira expected keys instead of ids.
- `--allow-partial` exists because a fetch can fail if even one requested extra field, property, or expansion is bad or unsupported. This flag says: give me what you can instead of failing the whole request. Without it, one bad add-on request can block the entire fetch.
- `--no-config-prompt` exists for non-interactive use. The normal CLI tries to help a human by prompting for missing Jira settings on first run. This flag turns that off so a script, automation step, or controlled validation run fails immediately instead of waiting for user input.

### What they provide in practice

- `--field <name>` widens the source Jira payload with one or more extra fields. It does not automatically add new normalized keys, but it can make those raw values available for inspection or future normalization work.
- `--expand <name>` widens the response by asking Jira for fuller nested structures.
- `--property <key>` pulls targeted issue-property data into the Jira response.
- `--fields-by-keys` changes how Jira resolves the field identifiers you requested.
- `--allow-partial` makes exploratory fetches more forgiving.
- `--no-config-prompt` makes the CLI behave predictably in scripted or approval-based workflows.
